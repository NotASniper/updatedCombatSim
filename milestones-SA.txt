 +10: Organized Code, readable and CONSISTENT formatting
 +10: UI is easy to follow
 +20: Program is able to track turns and actions of all entities, and calculate the correct damage based on the reactions specified in the readME
    +5 Enemys can have elements applied onto them, debuffs can expire after x rounds, and they take the correct amount of damage based on buffs or debuffs
    +5 Player turns apply elements, deal damage, and can activate resonances
    +5 Ultimate moves work, and still trigger reactions
    +5 Game ends when all enemies or players are dead
 I, Semilore Abiodun-Adeniyi, undertook this as a solo project, as a continuation of my 202 project. I wanted to implement UI and fix a lot of bugs the first iteration had,
 and so in this repo there is so far an updated Enemy class (2 hours), which should do better about handling stuff like DoT's and reactions.
 In addition to that I spent (3+ hours debugging and researching the pygame library, but will switch to unity if its easier)
